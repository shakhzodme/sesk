# introduction
 
Welcome to the **Software Engineer's Swiss Knife** (SESK) website.

During my entire career, I've been experimenting with various languages,
frameworks, tools, and etc. This journey led me to days of frustration
because of the thing I'm trying to achieve is not working as I intended.

Here I want to introduce you with a set of techniques I use in my daily
life. I'm writing this website as a documentation of an algorithm which you can
use separately or in combination with each other.

Feel free to leave a question or suggestion in [github repo](https://github.com/shakhzodme/sesk)
